# uncertainty-quantification

Code for "Quantifying uncertainty in area and regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps." https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13659

We apply uncertainty quantification to four estimation examples: Iowa corn area (simulation), Brazilian Amazon deforestation area and logistic regression coefficients, and US tree cover linear regression coefficients.
